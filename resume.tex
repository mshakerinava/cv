% \begin{itemize}

% \item \textbf{Learning on Spherical Data}:
% I'm currently working on learning from data that lies on the surface of a sphere.
% Examples of such data include Cosmological Microwave Background (CMB) maps, omni-directional images, and global climate records.
% We model the sphere as a platonic solid with pixelized faces.
% By combining the symmetry of the platonic solid with independendent translation symmetry of the face pixelization, we obtain a surrogate symmetry for the whole sphere.
% We then design a linear layer that respects this symmetry and show that a deep neural network with this kind of layer is able to achive
% state-of-the-art results on omni-directional image segmentation and segmentation of extreme climate events.

% \item \textbf{Equivariant Compression}:
% We are investigating layers that are able to reduce the dimension of data while exactly preserving
% the inherent symmetries. Such layers may provide a mathematically principled approach to
% disentangling factors of variation.

% \begin{itemize}

% \item \textbf{Deep Reinforcement Learning}:
% I Assisted a senior M.Sc. student in his thesis research.
% I implemented several deep reinforcement learning agents and trained them to play Atari.
% I also trained environment models using data gathered from trained agents.
% We also performed many experiments on intrinsic motivation and exploration in deep reinforcement learning.

% \item \textbf{Graph Representation Learning}:
% We interpreted the commute distance of nodes in a graph as a measure of locality
% and designed a convolutional layer that is local with respect to this measure.
% We also theoretically proved that such a graph convolution layer is $\epsilon$-spectral.
% To process signals on a given graph, first,
% the commute distance is obtained in a preprocessing step via spectral graph embedding.
% Then, we construct a convolutional neural network based on the obtained node embedding.
% I implemented and evaluated this method on various datasets.

% \begin{itemize}

% \item \textbf{Data Prefetching}: Memory access is the performance bottleneck in most modern computer systems, and therefore, reducing the number of cache misses is of paramount importance.
% One widely used approach in this regard is data prefetching.
% Data prefetching consists of predicting future memory requests and (pre-)fetching those memory blocks into the cache, before they are explicitly requested by the processor.
% In this work, I implemented and helped develop several novel algorithms for data prefetching.
% One of these prefetchers, named Bingo, is the current state-of-the-art for prefetching in multi-core systems.
% Bingo was published in \textit{HPCA}, which is one of the most prestigious conferences in computer architecture.
